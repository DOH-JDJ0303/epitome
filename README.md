# EPITOME: Enchanced Phylogenetic Inference Through Optimized Mapping Efficiency

EPITOME attempts to condense a supplied set of closely related DNA sequences (species-level or closer) into discrete, composite sequences based on a user-defined genetic distance. In other words, EPITOME creates sequences which are the _epitome_ of the overarching diversity within the dataset. This can be useful for identify a set of distinct references for consensus-based viral genome assembly pipelines like [VAPER](https://github.com/DOH-JDJ0303/VAPER).
