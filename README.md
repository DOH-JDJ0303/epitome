# EPITOME: Enchanced Phylogenetic Inference Through Optimized Mapping Efficiency

EPITOME attempts to condense a diverse set of DNA sequences (species-level or closer) into discrete, composite sequences that represent the overarching diversity of the dataset. In other words, EPITOME creates sequences which are the _epitome_ of the dataset diversity. This is accomplished by clustering sequencing into closely related clusters based on their pairwise genetic distances. This can be useful for identifying distinct reference genomes for consensus-based viral genome assembly pipelines, like [VAPER](https://github.com/DOH-JDJ0303/VAPER).
